    <h1>Ozimandias</h1>
    <h3>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
    <p>I met a traveller from an antique land,<br/>
    Who said-"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone,<br/>
Stand in the desert .... Near them, on the sand,<br/>
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whhose frown,<br/>
And wrinkled lip, an sneer of cold command,<br/>
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br/>
Which yet survibe, stamped on these lifeless things,<br/>
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br/>
And on the pedestal, these word appear:<br/>
My name is <span>ozymandias</span>, King of Kings;<br/>
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br/>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br/>
of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br/>
The lone and levelsands stretch far away."<br/>
</p>
